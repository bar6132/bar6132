# Hi there, I'm Bar Yael 👋

### 🚀 Full Stack Engineer | Technical Product Manager | AI & Cloud Architecture
I act in a dual capacity to drive engineering and product strategy for high-traffic media platforms. With a background as an **F-15 Crew Chief** in the IAF, I bring a mission-critical, high-pressure mindset to distributed systems and production code.

- 💼 **Currently:** Full Stack Developer & TPM at **The Jerusalem Post Group** (Walla!, Maariv, JPost).
- 📈 **Impact:** Recently engineered caching tools that **reduced server load times by ~45%** for millions of monthly users.
- 🔭 **Working on:** High-availability microservices, Real-time publishing workflows, and Generative AI integration.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** .NET 8 vs Python for backend, RAG Systems, and effectively bridging business goals with engineering specs.
